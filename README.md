V0.1: Currently deployed, was made for a friend who set up their PC after resetting everything

Things i will add:

- Search option for Winget and Chocolatey packages (CLI ONLY(V2 will have full GUI support))
- Option to add custom packages for chocolatey with ease (automated package creation based on URL and hash)
- Option to select where to install it if multiple drives are available, with option to install it on C: drive by default
- Fully open source and easily being used by people that aren't great with using PCs
